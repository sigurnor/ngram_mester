the day is always the same and the morning follows the same pattern as the day before. the quiet room stands in the same light and the familiar sound returns in the same slow rhythm. the day moves forward in a steady line and the same thoughts appear in the same order as they did the day before. the time passes in the same calm manner and the morning brings the same feeling of slow repetition. the routine begins with the same simple steps and the hours continue with the same predictable motion. the day goes on without change and the quiet air carries the same soft tone that it carried yesterday and the day before that.

every action seems to follow the same path and every moment reflects the same steady pace. the morning arrives with the same pale light and the same quiet movement through the room. the day stretches out with the same calm surface and the same slow turning of time. each hour repeats the same pattern and each step brings the same simple result. the quiet moment after each small task has the same shape and the same unbroken stillness. the day ends the same way it began, with the same quiet sense of repetition and the same steady passing of time.

the next morning begins in the same manner with the same light entering the room and the same sound settling in the air. the familiar rhythm returns again with the same predictable structure and the same slow pace. the day continues with the same sequence of small actions and each action feels like a precise copy of the day before. there is the same calm tone in the room and the same repetition in every movement. the time flows in the same quiet stream and the hours remain unchanged as they pass. the end of the day arrives with the same quiet closure and the same repeated impression of time moving without variation.

the cycle repeats again with the same morning and the same day following behind it. the quiet surroundings hold the same stillness and the same unbroken calm. the hours move with the same slow certainty and the tasks unfold with the same structure and the same expected results. each moment carries the same steady rhythm and each pause settles with the same gentle silence. the pattern remains unchanged and the day completes itself in the same way again and again. the repetition continues without interruption and the familiar sequence remains the same from morning to night. the day is always the same and the morning always returns with the same unvaried light.
